# DC Metro Challenge Optimizer

An intelligent system to optimize the fastest route to visit all DC Metro stations, aiming to break the current world record of ~7 hours using modern data science and reinforcement learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project combines real-time transit data, reinforcement learning, and optimization techniques to:
1. Find the optimal path to visit all DC Metro stations
2. Provide real-time decision support during record attempts

## Key Features

- Real-time WMATA API integration for live transit data
- Reinforcement learning model for dynamic decision-making
- Interactive dashboard for real-time navigation
- Comprehensive analysis of historical transit patterns
- Route optimization using graph theory and ML techniques

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file with your WMATA API key:
   ```
   WMATA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
